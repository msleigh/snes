This section provides information for developers on how to contribute to the project and understand the codebase.

## Code Structure

The codebase is organized into several key directories and files:

- `src/`: Contains the Fortran source code files for the main application logic, including modules for data handling, computation, and I/O operations.
- `qa/`: Includes input files for test problems and scripts for running and verifying tests.
- `nucdata/`: Stores nuclear data files used by the application for simulations.
- `docs/`: Contains documentation files, including user and developer guides, and configuration for building the documentation.
- `Makefile`: Defines build rules for compiling the application and running tests.
- `Dockerfile`: Provides instructions for building a Docker image to run the application in a containerized environment.

Each directory and file plays a specific role in the development and execution of the software, ensuring modularity and ease of maintenance.
